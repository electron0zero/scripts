This folder contains helper python script that
- reads urls from `urls.txt`
- fetch file from each url
- rename it and convert to lowercase as per convention of `<github-username>-<repo-name>-<branch>-<filename>`
- save file in `_includes/readme` or path set in `basepath`
- now you can include the readme files into your jekyll posts or somewhere you wanted to use them.
